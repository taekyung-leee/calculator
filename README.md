# calculator
This project was built with the goal of providing the user with a calculator which has an easy interface to use. 
It provides the user with a basic layout and can perform algorithmic equations. 
This calculator gives options to choose between basic calculator functions and opening existing files to execute calculations.
It uses defensive programming, where the code can detect ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, and FileNotFoundError

Option 1: the function will execute the calculation based on the user input(two numbers and one operator).
Option 2: the function will import the file that the user entered, and display the calculation based on the text file.
Option 3: the user can exit the code.
