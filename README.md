# calculator
This project was built with the goal of providing the user with a calculator which has an easy interface to use. 
It provides the user with a basic layout and can perform algorithmic equations. 
This calculator gives options to choose between basic calculator functions and opening existing files to execute calculations.

When the user chooses option 1, it will operate a calculation based on the numbers and the operator user entered. 
When the user chooses option 2, it will import the existing file (i.e calculator.txt) to execute the calculation.
When the user chooses option 3, it will exit.
